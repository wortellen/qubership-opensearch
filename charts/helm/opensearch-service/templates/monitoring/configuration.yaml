    # Telegraf Configuration
    #
    # Telegraf is entirely plugin driven. All metrics are gathered from the
    # declared inputs, and sent to the declared outputs.
    #
    # Plugins must be declared in here to be active.
    # To deactivate a plugin, comment out the name and any variables.
    #
    # Use 'telegraf -config telegraf.conf -test' to see what metrics a config
    # file would generate.
    #
    # Environment variables can be used anywhere in this config file, simply prepend
    # them with $. For strings the variable must be within quotes (ie, "$STR_VAR"),
    # for numbers and booleans they should be plain (ie, $INT_VAR, $BOOL_VAR)


    # Global tags can be specified here in key="value" format.
    [global_tags]
      # dc = "us-east-1" # will tag all metrics with dc=us-east-1
      # rack = "1a"
      ## Environment variables can be used as tags, and throughout the config file
      # user = "$USER"
      project_name= "$OS_PROJECT"

      ## ie, if interval="10s" then always collect on :00, :10, :20, etc.
      round_interval = true

      ## Telegraf will send metrics to outputs in batches of at most
      ## metric_batch_size metrics.
      ## This controls the size of writes that Telegraf sends to output plugins.
      metric_batch_size = 1000

      ## are dropped first when this buffer fills.
      ## This buffer only fills when writes fail to output plugin(s).
      metric_buffer_limit = 10000

      ## Collection jitter is used to jitter the collection by a random amount.
      ## Each plugin will sleep for a random time within jitter before collecting.
      ## This can be used to avoid many plugins querying things like sysfs at the
      ## same time, which can have a measurable effect on the system.

      ## large write spikes for users running a large number of telegraf instances.
      ## ie, a jitter of 5s and interval 10s means flushes will happen every 10-15s
      flush_jitter = "0s"

      ## By default, precision will be set to the same timestamp order as the
      ## collection interval, with the maximum being 1s.
