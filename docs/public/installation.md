# Prerequisites

## Common

Before you start the installation and configuration of an OpenSearch cluster, ensure the following requirements are met:

* Kubernetes 1.21+ or OpenShift 4.10+
* `kubectl` 1.21+ or `oc` 4.10+ CLI
* Helm 3.0+
* All required CRDs are installed
  
Note the following terms:
* `DEPLOY_W_HELM` means installation is performed with `helm install/upgrade` commands, not `helm template + kubectl apply`.

### Custom Resource Definitions

The following Custom Resource Definitions should be installed to the cloud before the installation of OpenSearch:

* `OpenSearchService` - When you deploy with restricted rights or the CRDs' creation is disabled by the Deployer job. For more information, see [Automatic CRD Upgrade](#automatic-crd-upgrade).
* `GrafanaDashboard`, `PrometheusRule`, and `ServiceMonitor` - They should be installed when you deploy OpenSearch monitoring with `monitoring.enabled=true` and `monitoring.monitoringType=prometheus`.
   You need to install the Monitoring Operator service before the OpenSearch installation.
* `SiteManager` - It is installed when you deploy OpenSearch with Disaster Recovery support (`global.disasterRecovery.mode`). You have to install the SiteManager service before the OpenSearch
   installation.

**Important**: To create CRDs, you must have cloud rights for `CustomResourceDefinitions`.
If the deployment user does not have the necessary rights, you need to perform the steps described in the [Deployment Permissions](#deployment-permissions) section before the installation.

**Note**: If you deploy OpenSearch service to Kubernetes version less than 1.16, you have to manually install CRD from `config/crd/old/qubership.org_opensearchservices.yaml`
and disable automatic CRD creation by Helm in the following way:

* Specify the `--skip-crds` in `ADDITIONAL_OPTIONS` parameter of DP Deployer Job.
* Specify `DISABLE_CRD=true;` in the `CUSTOM_PARAMS` parameter of Groovy Deployer Job.

### Deployment Permissions

To avoid using `cluster-wide` rights during the deployment, the following conditions are required:

* The cloud administrator creates the namespace/project in advance.
* The following grants should be provided for the `Role` of the deployment user:

    </details>

The following rules require `cluster-wide` permissions. If it is not possible to provide them to the deployment user, you have to apply the resources manually.

* If OpenSearch is installed in the disaster recovery mode and authentication on the disaster recovery server is enabled, cluster role binding for the `system:auth-delegator` role must be created.

  ```yaml
  kind: ClusterRoleBinding
  apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
  metadata:
    name: token-review-crb-NAMESPACE
  subjects:
    - kind: ServiceAccount
      name: opensearch-service-operator
      namespace: NAMESPACE
  roleRef:
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    kind: ClusterRole
    name: system:auth-delegator
  ```

* To avoid applying the CRD manually, the following grants should be provided for `ClusterRole` of the deployment user:

  ```yaml
      rules:
        - apiGroups: ["apiextensions.k8s.io"]
          resources: ["customresourcedefinitions"]
          verbs: ["get", "create", "patch"]
    ```

* The custom resource definition `OpenSearchService` should be created/applied before the installation if the corresponding rights cannot be provided to the deployment user.

    <!-- #GFCFilterMarkerStart# -->  
  The CRD for this version is stored in [crd.yaml](/charts/helm/opensearch-service/crds/crd.yaml) file and can be
  applied with the following command:

    ```sh
    kubectl replace -f crd.yaml
    ```

    <!-- #GFCFilterMarkerEnd# -->

* To run `privileged` containers or actions on Kubernetes before 1.25 version, apply `PodSecurityPolicy` from [psp.yaml](/charts/helm/opensearch-service/templates/psp.yaml),
  create `ClusterRole` with its usage, and bind it to `ServiceAccount` with `$OPENSEARCH_FULLNAME` name using `ClusterRoleBinding`.

* To run `privileged` containers or actions on Kubernetes 1.25+ version, provide the `privileged` policy to the OpenSearch namespace. It can be performed with the following command:

  ```bash
  kubectl label --overwrite ns "$OPENSEARCH_NAMESPACE" pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=privileged
  ```

  This command can be executed automatically with the `ENABLE_PRIVILEGED_PSS: true` property in the deployment parameters. It requires the following cluster rights for the deployment user:

  ```yaml
    - apiGroups: [""]
      resources: ["namespaces"]
      verbs: ["patch"]
      resourceNames:
      - $OPENSEARCH_NAMESPACE
  ```

* The `global.psp.create` parameter should be defined as "false".

### Multiple Availability Zone

If Kubernetes cluster has several availability zones, it is more reliable to start OpenSearch pods in different availability zones.
For more information, refer to [Multiple Availability Zone Deployment](#multiple-availability-zone-deployment).

### Storage Types

The following are a few approaches of storage management used in the OpenSearch service solution deployment:

* Dynamic Persistent Volume Provisioning
* Predefined Persistent Volumes

#### Dynamic Persistent Volume Provisioning

OpenSearch Helm installation supports specifying storage class for master, arbiter, and data Persistent Volume Claims.
If you are setting up the persistent volumes' resource in Kubernetes, map the OpenSearch pods to the volume using
the `opensearch.master.persistence.storageClass`, `opensearch.arbiter.persistence.storageClass`, or `opensearch.data.persistence.storageClass` parameter.

#### Predefined Persistent Volumes

If you have prepared Persistent Volumes without storage class and dynamic provisioning, you can specify Persistent Volumes names using
the `opensearch.master.persistence.persistentVolumes`, `opensearch.arbiter.persistence.persistentVolumes`, or `opensearch.data.persistence.persistentVolumes` parameter.

For example:

```yaml
opensearch:
  master:
    persistence:
      persistentVolumes:
        - pv-opensearch-master-1
        - pv-opensearch-master-2
        - pv-opensearch-master-3
```

Persistent Volumes should be created on the corresponding Kubernetes nodes and should be in the `Available` state.

Set the appropriate UID and GID on hostPath directories and rule for SELinux:

```sh
chown -R 1000:1000 /mnt/data/<pv-name>
```

You also need to specify node names through `opensearch.master.persistence.nodes`, `opensearch.arbiter.persistence.nodes`, or `opensearch.data.persistence.nodes` parameter in the same order
in which the Persistent Volumes are specified so that OpenSearch pods are assigned to these nodes.

According to the specified parameters, the `Pod Scheduler` distributes pods to the necessary Kubernetes nodes. For more information, refer to [Pod Scheduler](#pod-scheduler) section.

### Installation Modes

#### Joint

The OpenSearch `joint` installation mode implies that each node has `master`, `data`, and `client` roles.

#### Separate

The OpenSearch `separate` installation mode implies that each node either has one of the `master`, `data`, and `client` roles or a combination of the two.
For example, OpenSearch installation has 3 `master` nodes, 2 `data` nodes and 2 `client` nodes, or 3 nodes with `data` and `master` roles and 2 `client` nodes.

If `data` and `master` nodes are separated, it is important to specify persistent storages not only for `data` nodes but also for `master` nodes.
The size of persistent storage for a `master` node should be small. For example, `1Gi`.

#### Deployment With Arbiter Node

OpenSearch `arbiter` nodes installed to Kubernetes nodes different from `master` provide stability of the OpenSearch cluster if `master` nodes go down.

**Important**: `arbiter` nodes do not store any indices data, but still need PV to work, the size of persistent storage for `arbiter` node should be small.

## Kubernetes

* It is required to upgrade the component before upgrading Kubernetes. Follow the information in tags regarding
  Kubernetes certified versions.
* `vm.max_map_count` should be set to `262144`. To do this, use the following command on all Kubernetes nodes, where OpenSearch is running:

   ```bash
   sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
   ```

  If you deploy OpenSearch to manage Kubernetes cloud, add this command as a custom command of Kubernetes node initialization.

* For instance, custom user scripts for Amazon EKS are [EKS Launch Templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-templates.html).

  This operation can be performed automatically during the installation if `opensearch.sysctl.enabled` is set to "true", but it requires the permission to run `privileged` containers for the cluster.

  **Attention**: Running `privileged` containers is usually denied for public clouds.

  To run `privileged` containers, refer to the [Deployment Permissions](#deployment-permissions) section.

* If you install OpenSearch service on OpenDistro Elasticsearch service, execute the steps from [Migration from OpenDistro Elasticsearch](#migration-from-opendistro-elasticsearch).
* Persistent volumes should be created for `master` nodes in the `joint` mode and for `master` and `data` nodes in the `separate` mode.

## OpenShift

* It is required to upgrade the component before upgrading OpenShift. Follow the information in tags regarding OpenShift certified versions.
* `vm.max_map_count` should be set to `262144`. To do this, use the following command on all OpenShift nodes, where OpenSearch is running:

   ```bash
   sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
   ```

  This operation can be performed automatically during the installation if `opensearch.sysctl.enabled` is set to "true", but it requires the permission to run `privileged` containers for the cluster.

  To run `privileged` containers, refer to the [Deployment Permissions](#deployment-permissions) section.
* The following annotations should be specified for the project:

  ```sh
  oc annotate --overwrite ns ${OS_PROJECT} openshift.io/sa.scc.supplemental-groups="1000/1000"
  oc annotate --overwrite ns ${OS_PROJECT} openshift.io/sa.scc.uid-range="1000/1000"
  ```

* If you install OpenSearch on OpenDistro Elasticsearch service, execute the steps from [Migration from OpenDistro Elasticsearch](#migration-from-opendistro-elasticsearch).
* Persistent volumes should be created for `master` nodes in the `joint` mode and for `master` and `data` nodes in the `separate` mode.

## Google Cloud

1. Follow the guide at <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.4/repository-gcs.html#repository-gcs-using-service-account> to create a JSON service account file.
2. Create the secret with JSON in the `opensearch` namespace. For example:

    ```yaml
    kind: Secret
    apiVersion: v1
    metadata:
      name: opensearch-gcs-secret
      namespace: opensearch
    data:
      key: >-

    type: Opaque
    ```

3. Set `opensearch.snapshots.s3.gcs.secretName` and `opensearch.snapshots.s3.gcs.secretKey` parameters during the installation:

    ```yaml
    opensearch:
      snapshots:
        s3:
          gcs:
            secretName: "opensearch-gcs-secret"
            secretKey: "key"
    ```

# Best Practices and Recommendations

## OpenSearch Configurations

### Automatic Index Creation

It is recommended to disable automatic index creation for OpenSearch and create indices with corresponding request on applications side.
The automatic index creation may lead to unexpected index with default settings and shards which could lead to incorrect behaviour.

To disable automatic index creation you need to specify the following deployment parameter for OpenSearch and perform upgrade operation:

```yaml
opensearch:
  config:
    action.auto_create_index: false
```

To check is automatic index creation enabled or not in runtime you can execute the following request:

```bash
GET /_cluster/settings?include_defaults=true
```

And check the property: `auto_create_index`.

To disable automatic index creation in runtime you need to execute the following request:

```bash
PUT /_cluster/settings
{
   "persistent":{
      "action.auto_create_index": false
   }
}
```

**Note:** Automatic index creation is disabled by default (`opensearch.config.action.auto_create_index: false`) start from `opensearch-service:release-2024.4-1.12.0`.

## Index Configurations

### Number of Shards

The overall goal of choosing a number of shards is to distribute an index evenly across all data nodes in the cluster. However, these shards should not be too large or too numerous.
A general guideline is to try to keep shard size between:

* 10–30 GiB for workloads that prioritize low search latency
* 30–50 GiB for write-heavy workloads such as log analytics
* 20 shards per 1 GB of heap

Only performance testing different numbers of shards and different shard sizes can determine the optimal number of shards for your index.

The full recommendations you can find in [Size your shards](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/size-your-shards.html) and [Sizing OpenSearch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/sizing-domains.html).

### Index Templates

OpenSearch provides API for manage [Index Templates](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/im-plugin/index-templates/), and it still provides API for [legacy elasticsearch templates](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-templates-v1.html).

Both API, new composable index templates (`/_index_template`) and legacy templates (`/_template`) are avaialble now and can be used by applications,
but composable index templates have more features and more priority than legacy.

New OpenSearch index templates offer enhanced modularity, improved prioritization for layered configurations, and a more user-friendly API, ensuring better management and future-proofing
for index configurations. The new index templates are in line with OpenSearch's evolving features and capabilities.
Using them ensures compatibility with current and future versions of OpenSearch, along with support for the latest functionalities.

We strongly recommend to use only actual composable index templates (`/_index_template`) API and migrate current legacy templates.

## HWE

The provided values do not guarantee that these values are correct for all cases.
It is a general recommendation. The resources should be calculated and estimated for each project case with a test load on the SVT stand, especially the HDD size.

The Amazon guide suggests starting a configuration with 2 vCPU cores and 8 GiB of memory for every 100 GiB of storage requirement.
For more information, refer to [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/sizing-domains.html].

### Small

Recommended for development purposes, PoC, and demos. For 40 shards and 50Gb of indexed data.

The `v1` version allows to create users only with `admin` permissions, but the `v2` version creates 3 users with different roles (`admin`, `dml`, `readonly`) on each corresponding request. If you are upgraded OpenSearch DBaaS adapter from `v1` to `v2` version, you must not downgrade it. |

# Installation

## Before You Begin

* Make sure the environment corresponds the requirements in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.
* Make sure you review the [Upgrade](#upgrade) section.
* Before doing major upgrade, it is recommended to make a backup.
* Check if the application is already installed and find its previous deployments' parameters to make changes.

### Helm

To deploy via Helm you need to prepare yaml file with custom deploy parameters and run the following
command in [OpenSearch Chart](/charts/helm/opensearch-service):

```bash
helm install [release-name] ./ -f [parameters-yaml] -n [namespace]
```

If you need to use resource profile then you can use the following command:

```bash
helm install [release-name] ./ -f ./resource-profiles/[profile-name-yaml] -f [parameters-yaml] -n [namespace]
```

**Warning**: pure Helm deployment does not support the automatic CRD upgrade procedure, so you need to perform it manually.

```bash
kubectl replace -f ./crds/crd.yaml
```

# Upgrade

## Common

In the common way, the upgrade procedure is the same as the initial deployment. You need to follow `Release Notes` and `Breaking Changes` in the version you install to find details.
If you upgrade to a version which has several major diff changes from the installed version (e.g. `0.2.8` over `0.0.3`),
you need to check `Release Notes` and `Breaking Changes` sections for `0.1.0` and `0.2.0` versions.

## Scale-In Cluster

OpenSearch does not support reducing the number of nodes without additional manipulations to move data replicas from nodes being removed,
or understanding that there are enough data replicas on the remaining nodes, or data replicas can be moved to other nodes automatically without data loss.

## Rolling Upgrade

OpenSearch supports rolling upgrade feature with near-zero downtime.

### Operator rolling upgrade feature

According to [Rolling Upgrade](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/install-and-configure/upgrade-opensearch/rolling-upgrade/) article in the OpenSearch documentation
the cluster should be prepared before performing the rolling upgrade procedure.
The operator can perform the rolling upgrade on its own following the recommendations.

In order to enable that functionality set `opensearch.rollingUpdate` parameter to `true` and use default update strategies in master and data stateful sets.

If operator crashes or restarts while performing rolling upgrade procedure, upgrade will be continued after the operator is restored.

#### Algorithm description

##### Preparation

1. Operator checks that OpenSearch stateful set has `OnDelete` update strategy. Which OpenSearch stateful set will be used depends on installation mode.
2. Operator checks for at least one non-updated replica.
3. Operator checks that OpenSearch is healthy.

If all criteria are accepted then operator starts rolling upgrade procedure. Otherwise, the rolling upgrade procedure is skipped.

##### Rolling Upgrade procedure

1. Operator disables OpenSearch shard replication.
2. Operator sends request to OpenSearch to perform flush procedure.
3. Operator deletes non-updated OpenSearch pods one by one waiting for OpenSearch to become ready.
4. Operator enables OpenSearch shard replication.

## CRD Upgrade

Custom resource definition `OpenSearchService` should be upgraded before the installation if the new version has major changes.
<!-- #GFCFilterMarkerStart# -->
The CRD for this version is stored in [crd.yaml](/charts/helm/opensearch-service/crds/crd.yaml) and can be applied with the following command:

```sh
kubectl replace -f crd.yaml
```
<!-- #GFCFilterMarkerEnd# -->
It can be done automatically during the upgrade with [Automatic CRD Upgrade](#automatic-crd-upgrade) feature.

### Automatic CRD Upgrade

It is possible to upgrade CRD automatically on the environment to the latest one which is presented with the installing version.
This feature is enabled by default if the `DISABLE_CRD` parameter is not `true`.

Automatic CRD upgrade requires the following cluster rights for the deployment user:

```yaml
  - apiGroups: [ "apiextensions.k8s.io" ]
    resources: [ "customresourcedefinitions" ]
    verbs: [ "get", "create", "patch" ]
```

## Migration

### Migration to OpenSearch 2.x (OpenSearch Service 1.x.x)

There are the following breaking changes:

1. The `type` parameter has been removed from all OpenSearch API endpoints. Instead, indices can be categorized by document type.
   For more details, see [Remove mapping types](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch/issues/1940) issue.
2. The OpenSearch recommends TLS for REST layer if security is enabled. So, by default all layers (`transport`, `admin`, `rest`) are encrypted since 2.x version of OpenSearch.
   For more details, see [Security Admin](https://opensearch.org/docs/2.4/security/configuration/security-admin/#basic-usage) article in OpenSearch documentation and
   [Disabled TLS for REST is an unsupported configuration](https://github.com/opensearch-project/documentation-website/issues/913) issue.

**Important**: By default, TLS certificates for all layers (`transport`, `admin`, `rest`) are self-signed,
so you will not be able to communicate with the OpenSearch without specifying corresponding certificate. For more details, refer to the [TLS Encryption](/docs/public/tls.md) section.

If you need migrate to OpenSearch Service `1.x.x` (with OpenSearch 2.x) from previous version there are the following rules:

**If TLS enabled:**

* No additional steps required, upgrade as is from any OpenSearch Service version.

**If TLS disabled:**

* Disable OpenSearch TLS on REST layer with property (`opensearch.tls.enabled: false`).
* Depending on the installed OpenSearch Service version:
  * if [0.2.4](https://github.com/Netcracker/opensearch-service/-/tags/0.2.4) (or newest) version installed just proceed with upgrade.
  * if version before `0.2.4` installed, you need previously upgrade to version `0.2.4` to migrate security configuration to new format and then install required `1.x.x` version.

### Migration From OpenDistro Elasticsearch

OpenSearch Service allows migration from OpenDistro Elasticsearch deployments.

There are 3 ways for migration:

1. Automatic via Deployer Job (DP|App)
2. Manual Steps
3. Backup and Restore

**Note**: If you need to migrate from Elasticsearch 6.8 cluster to OpenSearch, refer to [Migrate From Elasticsearch Service](#migrate-from-elasticsearch-68-service).

OpenSearch also can be deployed with the same name as OpenDistro Elasticsearch installation:

```yaml
nameOverride: "elasticsearch"
fullnameOverride: "elasticsearch"
```

In this case no necessary to perform steps for the persistent volume migration because names of entities are the same. But this is not recommended way, because OpenSearch is the different solution.

**Note**: Refer to the general [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) and perform the necessary steps before the deployment.

#### Manual Migration Steps

The following steps should be performed from the host with installed `kubectl`, `helm` and `cluster-wide` rights to the cluster.

1. Uninstall existing OpenDistro Elasticsearch Helm release:

   For Deployer installations:

    ```sh
    helm uninstall elasticsearch-service
    ```

   Or all resources if previous installation was not Helm-based:

    ```sh
    kubectl delete all --all -n {NAMESPACE}
    kubectl delete secret --all -n {NAMESPACE}
    kubectl delete configmap --all -n {NAMESPACE}
    ```

2. Patch existing persistent volumes of Elasticsearch data (not snapshot) to `Retain` policy:

   ```sh
   kubectl patch pv <your-pv-name> -p '{"spec":{"persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy":"Retain"}}'
   ```

   You can get the persistent volume names from the persistent volume claims via ```kubectl get pvc```.
3. Delete existing persistent volume claims of Elasticsearch data (not snapshot):

   ```sh
   kubectl delete pvc <your-pvc-name>
   ```

4. Patch existing persistent volumes of Elasticsearch data (not snapshot) to available status:

   ```sh
   kubectl patch pv <your-pv-name> -p '{"spec":{"claimRef": null}}'
   ```

5. Deploy OpenSearch service specifying the previous persistent volumes and storage class for OpenSearch persistent parameters and previous persistent volume claim for snapshot:

    ```yaml
    opensearch:
      master:
        replicas: 3
        persistence:
          enabled: true
          storageClass: local-storage
          persistentVolumes:
            - pv-elasticsearch-1
            - pv-elasticsearch-2
            - pv-elasticsearch-3
      snapshots:
        enabled: true
        persistentVolumeClaim: pvc-elasticsearch-snapshots
    ```

   Any deployment mode can be used.

#### Backup and Restore

With this approach snapshots collected on Elasticsearch side and restored on OpenSearch side. This migration also requires manual steps.

**Prerequisites**: Elasticsearch and OpenSearch clusters should be installed with enabled independent snapshots storages (Separate snapshot PVC with access from all Elasticsearch/OpenSearch pods)

1. Perform manual backup on Elasticsearch side:
   * From any Elasticsearch pod, run the backup procedure (all pods have access to snapshots, so it doesn't matter, what pod to choose here and below):

     ```bash
     curl -XPUT -u username:password "http://localhost:9200/_snapshot/${SNAPSHOTS_REPOSITORY_NAME:-snapshots}/${SNAPSHOT_NAME:-elasticsearch_snapshot}?wait_for_completion=true"
     ```

     With Elasticsearch `username:password` specified.

   * Check the snapshot status and indices from response.
     <!-- #GFCFilterMarkerStart# -->Additional information about manual backup described in
     [Manual backup guide](https://git.qubership.org/PROD.Platform.ElasticStack/elasticsearch-service/-/blob/master/documentation/maintenance-guide/backup/manual-backup-procedure.md)
     <!-- #GFCFilterMarkerEnd# -->

2. Copy `snapshots` directory from Elasticsearch side:

   * Use `kubectl` with config on Elasticsearch cluster:

     ```bash
     kubectl cp elasticsearch-pod-name:/usr/share/elasticsearch/snapshots ./snapshots/ -n elasticsearch-namespace
     ```

     With `elasticsearch-pod-name` and `elasticsearch-namespace`. Snapshots will be copied to local path `./snapshots`.

3. Copy `snapshots` directory from local environment to OpenSearch cluster:

   * Use `kubectl` with config on OpenSearch cluster

     ```sh
     kubectl cp ./snapshots/ opensearch-pod-name:/usr/share/opensearch -n opensearch-namespace
     ```

     With `opensearch-pod-name` and `opensearch-namespace`. Snapshots will be copied from local path `./snapshots`.

4. Perform manual restore on OpenSearch side:

   * From any OpenSearch pod run restore procedure

     ```bash
     curl -XPOST -u username:password "http://localhost:9200/_snapshot/${SNAPSHOTS_REPOSITORY_NAME:-snapshots}/${SNAPSHOT_NAME:-elasticsearch_snapshot}/_restore"
     ```

     With OpenSearch `username:password` specified and `SNAPSHOT_NAME` the same, that was defined for backup on Elasticsearch side.

   * Check that response is `"accepted":true`. Otherwise, some problem occurred and described in response, such as already existing open index in new cluster,
     but if OpenSearch cluster has clean installation, no conflicts expected. If such problem reproduced, close or delete indices that already exists or use renaming pattern.
     <!-- #GFCFilterMarkerStart# --> Additional information about manual snapshot recovery described in
     [Manual recovery guide](https://git.qubership.org/PROD.Platform.ElasticStack/elasticsearch-service/-/blob/master/documentation/maintenance-guide/recovery/manual-recovery-procedure.md)
     <!-- #GFCFilterMarkerEnd# -->

#### Migrate From Elasticsearch 6.8 Service

It is also possible to migrate from Elasticsearch 6.8 installations, but only with manual steps.

##### Migrate Elasticsearch 6.8 Persistent Volumes

1. Folder rights

   If previously Persistent Volumes `hostPath` folders were created with rights `100:101` it is necessary to change folders owner to `1000:1000`.

   If running as `root` user is allowed, you need to add the following deploy parameters:

    ```yaml
    opensearch:
      securityContextCustom:
        runAsUser: 1000
        fsGroup: 1000
      fixMount:
        enabled: true
        securityContext:
          runAsUser: 0
    ```

   If running as `root` user is not allowed, you need to change folders owner manually:

    ```yaml
    chown 1000:1000 -R /data/pv1
    ```

   The same for the snapshot persistent volume.

2. Naming and Persistent Volume Claims

   If persistent volume claims exist and have naming `pvc-opensearch-0(1,2)` then you can use them without specifying storage class or persistent volume names.

   If you use `hostPath` predefined persistent volumes, you need to specify `nodes` to assign pods:

    ```yaml
    opensearch:
      master:
        persistence:
          nodes:
            - node-1
            - node-2
            - node-3
    ```

   If persistent volume claims have another naming you have to specify both `persistentVolumes` and `nodes` during deployment.

   If persistent volumes were created with `storageClass` you need to specify it without specifying `nodes`.

   Creating new persistent volume claims for existing utilized persistent volumes requires you to unbind persistent volumes from previous claims. You can do it with the following command:

    ```sh
    kubectl patch pv pv1 -p '{"spec":{"claimRef": null}}'
    ```

   Old persistent volume claims should be removed with removing deployments of previous installation.

##### Manual Migration From Elasticsearch 6.8

1. Perform steps from [Migrate Elasticsearch 6.8 Persistent Volumes](#migrate-elasticsearch-68-persistent-volumes).
2. Delete previous deployments

   Delete previous Helm release. For example:

    ```sh
    helm uninstall elasticsearch-service -n elasticsearch-cluster
    ```

   Delete previous non-Helm resources. For example:

    ```sh
    kubectl delete secret --all -n elasticsearch-cluster
   
    kubectl delete configmap --all -n elasticsearch-cluster
    ```

3. Install OpenSearch release.

### DBaaS Adapter Migration

There is no migration between the Elasticsearch DBaaS adapter and the OpenSearch DBaaS adapter, because they use different approaches for managing resources and different microservice clients.

If you want to upgrade OpenSearch service from `0.0.2` or lower version to `0.0.3` or higher version, you need to decide which DBaaS adapter you want to use.
If you want to continue using the Elasticsearch DBaaS adapter, you have to update your installation parameters and replace the following part:

```yaml
dbaasAdapter:
  enabled: true
  ...
```

with the following:

```yaml
elasticsearchDbaasAdapter:
  enabled: true
  ...
```

If you want to use the OpenSearch DBaaS adapter, you have to manually adapt service with one of the following options:

* Edit `physical_database` table in Postgres that is used by DBaaS aggregator:

  * Find the record in the `physical_database` table that matches your `physical_database_identifier` with the following command:

    ```text
    select * from physical_database where physical_database_identifier='<physical_database_identifier>';
    ```

  * Change the type of the found physical database from `elasticsearch` to `opensearch` with the following command:

    ```text
    update physical_database set type = 'opensearch' where physical_database_identifier='<physical_database_identifier>';
    ```

  * Restart DBaaS aggregator.

* Add or update `dbaasAdapter.dbaasAggregatorPhysicalDatabaseIdentifier` parameter in OpenSearch service parameters during its installation. For example,

  ```yaml
  dbaasAdapter:
    ...
    dbaasAggregatorPhysicalDatabaseIdentifier: "opensearch-dbaas-adapter"
  ```

  **Pay attention**, the value of this parameter should differ from the default value (the name of namespace where OpenSearch service is located).

## Rollback

OpenSearch does not support rollback with downgrade of a version. In this case, you need to do the following steps:

1. Deploy the previous version using the `Clean Install` mode of Deployer.
2. Restore the data from backup.

# Additional Features

## Multiple Availability Zone Deployment

When deploying to a cluster with several availability zones, it is important that OpenSearch pods start in different availability zones.

### Affinity

You can manage pods' distribution using `affinity` rules to prevent Kubernetes from running OpenSearch pods on nodes of the same availability zone.

**Note**: This section describes deployment only for `storage class` persistent volumes (PV) type because with predefined PV, the OpenSearch pods are started on the nodes
that are specified explicitly with persistent volumes. In that way, it is necessary to take care of creating PVs on nodes belonging to different availability zones in advance.

#### Replicas Fewer Than Availability Zones

For cases when the number of OpenSearch pods (value of the `opensearch.master.replicas` parameter) is equal to or less than the number of availability zones,
you need to restrict the start of pods to one pod per availability zone. You can also specify additional node affinity rule to start pods on allowed Kubernetes nodes.

For this, you can use the following affinity rules:

<details>
<summary>Click to expand YAML</summary>

```yaml
opensearch:
  master:
    affinity: {
      "podAntiAffinity": {
        "requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution": [
          {
            "labelSelector": {
              "matchLabels": [
                "role": "master"
              ]
            },
            "topologyKey": "topology.kubernetes.io/zone"
          }
        ]
      },
      "nodeAffinity": {
        "requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution": {
          "nodeSelectorTerms": [
            {
              "matchExpressions": [
                {
                  "key": "role",
                  "operator": "In",
                  "values": [
                    "compute"
                  ]
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
```

</details>

Where:

* `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` is the name of the label that defines the availability zone. This is the default name for Kubernetes 1.17+. Earlier, `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone` was used.
* `role` and `compute` are the sample name and value of label that defines the region to run OpenSearch pods.

#### Replicas More Than Availability Zones

For cases when the number of OpenSearch pods (value of the `opensearch.master.replicas` parameter) is greater than the number of availability zones, you need to restrict the start of pods to
one pod per node and specify the preferred rule to start on different availability zones. You can also specify an additional node affinity rule to start the pods on allowed Kubernetes nodes.

For this, you can use the following affinity rules:

<details>
<summary>Click to expand YAML</summary>

```yaml
opensearch:
  master:
    affinity: {
      "podAntiAffinity": {
        "requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution": [
          {
            "labelSelector": {
              "matchLabels": [
                "role": "master"
              ]
            },
            "topologyKey": "kubernetes.io/hostname"
          }
        ],
        "preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution": [
          {
            "weight": 100,
            "podAffinityTerm": {
              "labelSelector": {
                "matchLabels": [
                  "role": "master"
                ]
              },
              "topologyKey": "topology.kubernetes.io/zone"
            }
          }
        ]
      },
      "nodeAffinity": {
        "requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution": {
          "nodeSelectorTerms": [
            {
              "matchExpressions": [
                {
                  "key": "role",
                  "operator": "In",
                  "values": [
                    "compute"
                  ]
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
```

</details>

Where:

* `kubernetes.io/hostname` is the name of the label that defines the Kubernetes node. This is a standard name for Kubernetes.
* `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` is the name of the label that defines the availability zone. This is a standard name for Kubernetes 1.17+. Earlier, `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone` was used.
* `role` and `compute` are the sample name and value of the label that defines the region to run OpenSearch pods.
